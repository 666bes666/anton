# Configuration

To configure the bot, right-click on the bot's username in the user list and select "Configure Bot". This will open a modal where you can set:

*   **Target Channel**: The channel where daily messages will be sent.
*   **Send Time**: The time in UTC for sending the message (e.g., `08:00`).
*   **Message Content**: The message to be sent daily.

After submitting the form, the bot will be configured for your server.
