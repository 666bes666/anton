# Installation

To add the bot to your Discord server, you need to follow these steps:

1.  **Invite the bot**: Use the OAuth2 URL generator in the Discord Developer Portal to create an invite link. You'll need the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
2.  **Permissions**: The bot requires the following permissions:
    *   `Send Messages`
    *   `Manage Webhooks` (if you plan to use webhooks)
    *   `Read Message History` (for commands that require it)

Once the bot is on your server, you can start configuring it.
