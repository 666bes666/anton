# Monitoring

## Logging

The bot uses Python's built-in `logging` module with structured logging. Log levels are configurable, and logs include timestamps, log levels, and detailed messages.

## Health Checks

The Docker container includes a health check command that can be used by orchestration systems to monitor the bot's health.

## Metrics

For production deployments, you may want to add metrics collection. Consider integrating with:

-   **Prometheus**: For collecting custom metrics.
-   **Grafana**: For visualizing metrics and logs.
-   **Sentry**: For error tracking and performance monitoring.
